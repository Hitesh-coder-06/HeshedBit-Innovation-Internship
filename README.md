--HashedBit Innovations - Web Developer Internship

This repository contains my web development internship projects built during my online internship at HashedBit Innovation. It includes responsive webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to build real-world website components such as headers, navigation bars, sidebars, content sections, and footers. This internship enhanced my skills in clean UI design, code organization, and cross-device compatibility.
