    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science focused on creating machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and language understanding. AI systems use algorithms and data to recognize patterns and make decisions. It powers technologies like voice assistants, recommendation systems, self-driving cars, and medical diagnosis tools. AI is transforming industries by automating routine work and enabling smarter insights. As AI continues to evolve, ethical considerations such as privacy and bias are becoming increasingly important. Ultimately, AI aims to augment human capabilities and improve everyday life.
